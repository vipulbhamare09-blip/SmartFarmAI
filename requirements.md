# SmartFarm AI - Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview
SmartFarm AI is an intelligent agriculture assistant system that helps farmers improve crop productivity using AI-based soil analysis, fertilizer recommendations, weather insights, and disease prediction.

## 2. Problem Statement
Farmers often lack access to:
- Accurate soil health analysis
- Proper fertilizer recommendations
- Real-time weather insights
- Early crop disease detection

This leads to low productivity and financial loss.
